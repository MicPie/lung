Lung fibrosis and inflammation CNN

The notebooks uses the [dataset](https://osf.io/28qbc/) from the publication "[Deep neural network based histological scoring of lung fibrosis and inflammation in the mouse model system](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202708)" to train CNN based on a ResNet34 to characterize fibrotic and inflammatory lung diseases from sections of lung tissue.
